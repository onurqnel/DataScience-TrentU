# Lab 4: Matrix Multiplication & Runtime Measurements


# Question 1:
# Matrix multiplication is essential for performance in graphics, scientific computing and more.
# The standard matrix multiplication algorithm, based on classic mathematical definition,
# has a time complexity of O(n^3), but faster algorithms exist (i.e. Strassenâ€™s Algorithm).
# The standard algorithm's runtime grows quickly as the matrix size increases.  
# This happens because there are 3 loops, each going through n elements,  
# making the total number of operations (n x n x n) n^3.

# Question 2:
# The CPU handles matrix operations and processes them sequentially (modern ones uses multi-threading).  
# As we increase the matrix size, the number of operations grows cubically leading to longer runtimes.
# Other than Algorithmic improvements, we can accelerate performance by parallelizing the operation with GPUs or using optimization libraries.

# In order to correctly multiply two matrices, the following conditions must met:
# - The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
# - Since there is a shared property between the two matrices, we need three loop variables (i, j, k).

# The profile module measures memory usage and performance during matrix multiplication.
# It helps track how much memory is being used while executing the function multiply().
